Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using the No-show Appointments dataset available in Kaggle with the objective of proposing actions that might increase the appointment attendance rate. These action proposals would come from the result of analysing the dataset in order to answer the following questions:

Does the time between Scheduled and Appointment dates have an effect on the attendance rate?
How does patients' age impact on absenteeism?
Is the patients' location an important aspect to consider regarding the attendance?
File Descriptions
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebook includes the necessary data wrangling (gathering, assessing and cleaning) and data analysis steps for answering above questions. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The dataset in CSV format is also available in the repository.

Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
